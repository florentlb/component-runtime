TheÂ *Producer* defines the source logic of an input component. It handles the interaction with a physical source and produces input data for the processing flow.

A producer must have a `@Producer` method without any parameter. It is triggered by the `@Emitter` method of the partition mapper and can return any data. It is defined in the `<component_name>Source.java` file:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Producer
public MyData produces() {
    return ...;
}
