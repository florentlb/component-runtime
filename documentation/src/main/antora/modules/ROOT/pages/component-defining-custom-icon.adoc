:description: How to replace the default icon with a custom icon using Talend Component Kit
:keywords: component icon

Every component family and component needs to have a representative icon. +
You can use one of the icons provided by the framework or you can use a custom icon.

- For the component family the icon is defined in the `package-info.java` file.
- For the component itself, you need to declare the icon in the component class.

To use a custom icon, you need to have the icon file placed in the `resources/icons` folder of the project.
The icon file needs to have a name following the convention `IconName_icon32.png`, where you can replace `IconName` by the name of your choice.
