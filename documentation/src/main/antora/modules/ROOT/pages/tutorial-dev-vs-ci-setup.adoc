This tutorial shows how to adapt the test configuration of the Zendesk search component that was done in xref:tutorial-test-rest-api.adoc[this previous tutorial] to make it work in a Continuous Integration environment.

In the test, the Zendesk credentials are used directly in the code to perform a first capture of the API response. Then, fake credentials are used in the simulation mode because the real API is not called anymore.

However, in some cases, you can require to continue calling the real API on a CI server or on a specific environment.

To do that, you can adapt the test to get the credentials depending on the execution mode (simulation/passthrough).

== Setting up credentials
These instructions concern the CI server or on any environment that requires real credentials.

This tutorial uses:

- A https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Maven server] that supports password encryption as a credential provider. Encryption is optional but recommended.
- The `MavenDecrypterRule` test rule provided by the framework. This rule lets you get credentials from Maven settings using a server ID.

To create encrypted server credentials for the Zendesk instance:

1. Create a master password using the command: `mvn --encrypt-master-password <password>`.
2. Store this master password in the `settings-security.xml` file of the `~/.m2` folder.
3. Encrypt the Zendesk instance password using the command: `mvn --encrypt-password <zendesk-password>`.
4. Create a server entry under *servers* in Maven `settings.xml` file located in the `~/.m2` folder.
[source,xml]
----
    <server>
      <id>zendesk</id>
      <username>username@email.com</username>
      <password>The encrypted password {oL37x/xiSvwtlhrMQ=}</password>
    </server>
----

NOTE: You can store the `settings-security.xml` and `settings.xml` files elsewhere that the default location (`~/.m2`). To do that, set the path of the directory containing the files
in the `talend.maven.decrypter.m2.location` environment variable.

== Adapting the unit test
. Add the `MavenDecrypterRule` rule to the test class. This rule allows to inject server information stored in Maven `settings.xml` file to the test. The rule also decrypts credentials if they are encrypted.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",]
----
public class SearchTest {

    @Rule
    public final MavenDecrypterRule mavenDecrypterRule = new MavenDecrypterRule(this);
}
----

[start=2]
. Inject the Zendesk server to the test. To do that, add a new field to the class with the `@DecryptedServer` annotation, that holds the server ID to be injected.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",]
----
public class SearchTest {

    @Rule
    public final MavenDecrypterRule mavenDecrypterRule = new MavenDecrypterRule(this);

    @DecryptedServer("zendesk")
    private Server server;
}
----
The `MavenDecrypterRule` is able to inject the server instance into this class at runtime. The server instance contains the username and the decrypted password.

[start=3]
. Use the `server` instance in the test to get the real credentials in a secured manner.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",]
----
    BasicAuth basicAuth = new BasicAuth("https://instance.zendesk.com",
                                server.getUsername(),
                                server.getPassword());
----

Once modified, the complete test class looks as follows:
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="initial-block-closed"]
----
public class SearchTest {

    @ClassRule
    public static final SimpleComponentRule component = new SimpleComponentRule("component.package");

    private final MavenDecrypter mavenDecrypter = new MavenDecrypter();

    @ClassRule
    public static final JUnit4HttpApi API = new JUnit4HttpApi()
                                                        .activeSsl();

    @Rule
    public final JUnit4HttpApiPerMethodConfigurator configurator = new JUnit4HttpApiPerMethodConfigurator(API);

    @Rule
    public final MavenDecrypterRule mavenDecrypterRule = new MavenDecrypterRule(this);

    @DecryptedServer("zendesk")
    private Server server;

    @Test
    public void searchQuery() {
        // Initiating the component test configuration
        BasicAuth basicAuth = new BasicAuth("https://instance.zendesk.com", server.getUsername(), server.getPassword());
        final SearchQuery searchQuery = new SearchQuery(basicAuth, "type:ticket status:open", "created_at", "desc");

        // We convert our configuration instance to URI configuration
        final String uriConfig = SimpleFactory.configurationByExample()
                        .forInstance(searchQuery)
                        .configured().toQueryString();

        // We create our job test pipeline
        Job.components()
                .component("search", "zendesk://search?" + uriConfig)
                .component("collector", "test://collector")
                .connections()
                .from("search").to("collector")
                .build()
                .run();

        final List<JsonObject> res = component.getCollectedData(JsonObject.class);
        assertEquals(4, res.size());
    }
}

*This test will continue to work in simulation mode*, because the API simulation proxy is activated.

== Setting up the CI server in passthrough mode
This tutorial shows how to set up a CI server in passthrough mode using https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins].

. Log in to Jenkins.
. Click *New Item* to create a new build job.
+

. Enter an Item name (Job name) and choose the freestyle job. Then click OK.
+
image::jenkins/2_jenkins_new_item.png[Create a new job]
. In the *Source Code Management* section, enter your project repository URL. A GitHub repository is used in this tutorial.
. Specify the `master` branch as *Branches to build*.
+
image::jenkins/4_jenkins_source_code.png[Source Code Management]
. In the *Build* section, click *Add build step* and choose *Invoke top-level Maven targets*.
+
image::jenkins/6_jenkins_build_cmd.png[Build Section]
. Choose your Maven version and enter the Maven build command. In this case: `clean install`. Then, click *Save*.
+
image::jenkins/6_jenkins_build_cmd_2.png[Build Section]
+
The `-Dtalend.junit.http.passthrough=true` option is part of the build command.
This option tells the API simulation proxy to run in `passthrough` mode. This way, all the HTTP requests made in the test are forwarded to the real API server.
+
The `MavenDecrypterRule` rule allows to get the real credentials.
+
TIP: You can configure the *passthrough* mode globally on your CI server by setting the `talend.junit.http.passthrough` environment variable to `true`.
. Test the job by selecting *Build now*, and check that the job has built correctly.

Now your tests run in a simulation mode on your development environment and in a passthrough mode on your CI server.
