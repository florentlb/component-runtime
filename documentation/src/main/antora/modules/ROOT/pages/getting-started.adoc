//== Introducing Talend Component Kit

_Talend Component Kit_ is a framework designed to simplify the development of components at two levels:

* **Runtime**: Runtime is about injecting the specific component code into a job or pipeline. The framework helps unify as much as possible the code required to run in Data Integration (DI) and BEAM environments.
* **Graphical interface**: The framework helps unify the code required to be able to render the component in a browser (web) or in the Eclipse-based Studio (SWT).

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

In order to use Talend Component Kit, you need the following tools installed on your machine:

* Java JDK 1.8.x. You can download it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle] website.
* Apache Maven 3.5.x is recommended to develop a component or the project itself. You can download it from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp%3A%2F%2Fmirror.reverse.net%2Fpub%2Fapache%2F[Apache Maven] website. You can also use Gradle.
* A Java Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
* The version of your Studio is 7.0 and onwards.

[[getting-started-principles]]
== Main principles

Developing new components using the framework includes:

. Creating a project using the https://starter-toolkit.talend.io/[starter] or the xref:installing-talend-intellij-plugin.adoc[Talend IntelliJ plugin].
.. Defining the general configuration model for each component in your project
.. Generating and downloading the project's archive from the starter
.. Compiling the project
. Implementing the components
.. Registering the components family
.. Defining the layout and configurable part of the components
.. Defining the partition mapper for Input components
.. Implementing the source logic for Input components
.. Defining the processor for Output components
. Testing the components

Some additional configuration steps can be necessary according to your requirements:
