== Version compatibility

The version of Talend Component Kit you need to use to develop new components depends on the version of Talend Studio in which components will be integrated.

|*Talend product*|*Talend Component Kit version*
|Studio 7.1.1|Framework until 1.1.1
|Studio 7.0.1|Framework until 0.0.5

Talend recommends using the latest version of Talend Component Kit.

TIP: You can use a Snapshot of the version under development using the `-SNAPSHOT` version and Sonatype snapshot https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/[repository].

== Changing the Talend Component Kit version of your project

By default, creating a project using the Component Kit Starter will use the latest release of Talend Component Kit.

However, you can manually change the version of Talend Component Kit you use directly in the generated project.

. Go to your IDE and access the project root .pom file.
. Look for the `org.talend.sdk.component` dependency nodes.
. Replace the *version* in the relevant nodes with the version that you need to use for your project.
